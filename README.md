# Skylords Reborn API UI

Examples of `User Interfaces` for public `Application Programming Interfaces` of `Skylords Reborn` servers available for everyone to consume.

- `Auctions` - web application for visualization of running auctions from in-game auction house
- `Leaderboards` - web application for visualization of in-game ranking tables
- `Statistics` - web application for visualization of near-live statistics from both production and test servers

All web applications are made with `React` and `TypeScript`. 

The source codes also include `Jenkinsfile` (for CICD pipelines in Jenkins), `Dockerfile` (for image building with Docker) and `docker-compose.yml` (for running the built Docker images as containers). 

There are not much instructions included, besides those on how to consume the API, so you'll need some experience in working with mentioned tools/techonologies to be able to even understand what's going on.

Backend and frontend URLs for each of the running web applications can be found in respective `.env` and `README.md` files.
